# 👋🏾 Hello 
# Sheilla Macharia – Data Scientist Portfolio

## About Me
I am an early-career data scientist with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools such as Tableau. I have experience turning raw data into actionable insights, building dashboards, performing exploratory analyses, and validating key performance metrics. My projects span multiple domains including retail, telecom, media, social media analytics, and aviation risk.  

I am particularly interested in roles where I can use data to drive business decisions, optimize operations, and generate insights that directly impact commercial outcomes. I thrive in fast-paced environments, enjoy solving complex problems, and am always curious to understand the “why” behind the numbers.
